I am a professional programmer, but this is a weekend thing where i learned most stuff "on the fly". It's not meant to be a tutorial of any sorts, nor does it represent the best way to
code in GODOT. It is a personal experiment and will remain as such. It will be updated if i find anything deserving of an update.

# FlappyBird

This is a FlappyBird fork of https://github.com/shivmsit/FlappyBird for GoDot 3.5. It is not compatible with version 4.x

I mostly did this because the original game does not run on my Galaxy S24 Ultra since it doesn't support 32-bit apps.


Things i have added, simply because i love how entertaining, simple and fun this game is. I also love learning new stuff...
===========================================================================================================================

- Implemented night and day random backgrounds like in the original
- Implemented random selection of bird colours like in the original
- Implemented high score saves
- Implemented a simple high score table with the 5 best results of all time and some animation, to replace the original's google thing which is now a 404
- Fixed the bird animation during idle and gameplay. It is now 99% close to the original, also fixed the attitude (angle) when flying through the set
- Added better momentum hold when falling, to match the original more, it's almost the same now
- Fixed the speed at which the game runs, it was slower than the original
- Added a startup splash screen like the original. Had to capture an original screenshot for that, can't find it on the internet anywhere.
- Added missing sounds here and there
- Fixed lots of smaller issues such as the gap between pipes (it was too small), missing copyright message and overall feel. It resembles the original much more now
- Added a short (2.5 second) delay before the first pipes appear as it is in the original
- Added check for out of screen on top, as the bird could fly to the moon really
- Also added a really really hidden easter egg... If you play a lot (and i mean A LOT) you will eventually see it. Simple game, simple objectives...


Feel free to do whatever you want with this fork, my work is done here as i like the game simple as it is now.
