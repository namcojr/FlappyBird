# FlappyBird

This is a FlappyBird fork of https://github.com/shivmsit/FlappyBird. For GoDot 3.5, it is not compatible with 4.x
I mostly did this because the original game does not run on my Galaxy S24 Ultra (it doesn't support 32-bit apps).

Things i have added, simply because i love how entertaining, simple and fun this game is. I also love learning new stuff...
===========================================================================================================================

 - Implemented high score saves
 - Implemented a simple high score table with the 5 best results of all time and some animation, to replace the original's google thing
 - Fixed the bird animation during idle and gameplay. It is now 99% close to the original, also fixed the attitude (angle) when flying through the set
 - Added better momentum hold when falling, to match the original more
 - Added a startup splash screen like the original. Had to capture an original screenshot for that, can't find it on the internet anywhere.
 - Added missing sounds here and there
 - Fixed lots of smaller issues such as the pipe interval, game speed and overall feel. It resembles the original much more now
 - Also added a really really hidden easter egg... If you play a lot (and i mean A LOT) you will eventually see it.

 Feel free to do whatever you want with this fork, my work is done here as i like the game simple as it is now.
